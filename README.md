# Analysis-of-Weather-Data-using-K-means-Clustering


This project consists of a weather data set for the US state of Texas for duration of years from 2006 to 2010 where the analysis of this data set is performed through the application of clustering using K-means. The goal achieved in this project is the clustering of stations that display similar weather patterns for the specified month. The algorithm implemented here is the K-means algorithm and even different distance metrics are used to get the best clustering from the dataset
